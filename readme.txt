== Description ==

Lets users on your blog chat with you live through Google Chatback. If you are offline it links to a contact form instead.  Works great for live support or live help on your site!

This would not have been possible with out the Google Talk Status API in PHP here:  http://israelwebdev.wordpress.com/2009/02/05/google-talk-status-api-in-php/

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change the images shown for online and offline status? =

The images are located in the plugin folder (live-support.png and contact-us.png).  Simply replace these images with whatever you would like to be shown.  You must give the new images the same names.

For users of Adobe Photoshop I have included the PSD source files if you want to edit the icons.

= Where can I get a Google Talk Chatback hash key? =

Login to your Google account (Gmail account) and go to this site:

http://www.google.com/talk/service/badge/New

The hash key is the part between "tk=" and "&amp".  Simply copy and paste it into the "Chatback Hash" section of the widget.

= What do I put in the "Contact URL" section of the widget?  =

Put the URL to your contact form that you have on your website (ie:  http://yourdomain.com/contact-us/).
